Install OpenSSL if u dont have it.To check type OpenSSL to the terminal.

Create a location to store our local certificate files. This is not a requirement, but it makes it easier to find the keys later.

mkdir ~/certs
cd ~/certs

With that set up, we’re ready to generate the private key to become a local CA:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048

OpenSSL will ask for a passphrase, which we recommend not skipping and keeping safe. The passphrase will prevent anyone who gets your private key from generating a root certificate of their own. The output should look like this:

Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.................................................................+++
.....................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:

Next, we generate a root certificate:

openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem

You will be prompted for the passphrase of the private key you just chose and a bunch of questions. The answers to those questions aren’t that important. They show up when looking at the certificate, which you will almost never do. I suggest making the Common Name something that you’ll recognize as your root certificate in a list of other certificates. That’s really the only thing that matters.


Adding the Root Certificate to macOS Monterey Keychain
#Via the CLI

sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" myCA.pem



Via the macOS Keychain App

Open the macOS Keychain app
If required, make sure you’ve selected the System Keychain (older macOS versions default to this keychain)
Go to File > Import Items…
Select your private key file (i.e. myCA.pem)
Search for whatever you answered as the “Common Name” name above
Double-click on your root certificate in the list
Expand the Trust section
Change the “When using this certificate:” select box to Always TrustClose the certificate window
During the process it may ask you to enter your password (or scan your finger), do that
🎉 Celebrate!
